* Big Features
  --

* Code
  - [ ] Have a config file load static assets so you don't have to list all of them in the main html file.
** Templating
   - [ ] Have a way of being able to call a template from within a template.
   - [ ] Extend handlebars to allow looping through models without having to call toJSON on each model.
   - [ ] Compile templates server-side.


* Misc
  - The user should be able to quickly navigate various entries or
    browse through them all one-by-one without much delay. The use of
    modals doesn't allow this due to the time it takes for it to pop
    up.
